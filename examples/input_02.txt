go on seller central
* choose a product type - 50k browse nodes, key friction
* once selected, individual template
* begin filling it's advanced (required/optional/conditional), also price quantity, with all mkpls... many many columns
* very prone to error
* then you upload, wait around 30'to 2h get the feedback 
* error codes are not super clear, no help - need to go to seller help pages (scattered, not updated)
* SeSu don't have the right setup
* we only get feedback from AM managed SPs... except from listing frictions dashboard
    * missing required attributes
    * matching error
    * invalid value
* all teams working to fix this workflow
    * some teams working on similar to smart flat file
        * IN team working on the pre-fill experience using ML models; seller can provide any type of input; huge investment (language dependent)
        * in EU expansion we have big competitors, with the same tools, deterministic mapping between the value attributes for BOL.com, enforce that mapping, then leverage ML on top of that; intention was to merge these - built in blocks (ML, determenistic), each MKPL can decide what block to plug in (in EU Expansion deterministic, US the ML... and also
       
        * smart sheet which is something else (Retail EU), online experience for the flatfile, sellers don't have real time validation; with an online validation you can avoid the errors - then we can use another tool on top - next year to be launch for 1P & 3P - it's an online template, other catalogue providers use this, like bol.com, online template to fill in, you can download & summary reports, you can submit / save
        * pre-fill experience (will also use for API)
        * **ASIN list** to solve matching issue for the seller to use the 1x1 experience to have the results, which exist or not, they can confirm
            * then if it exists you only need to add offer-level attributes (price, quantity...)
            * in other countries, if MENA is doing it... why not also in US? copy the same detail page - copy & translate
        * HOOK will for matching products, you go to complete your drafts & in incomplete listings you can see the value we have in our catalogue, 1x1 to edit it - very low adoption rate


        * Catalogue requirements - metadata working on impacting this, phased listing experience; today we don't create the listing until all is there (required attributes), nudge the SP to add the attributes, to improve IDQ... listing team working team with CPG team - 1x1 for pilot, if it works it goes to bulk
            * this helps bring in more selection to Amazon
        * SPICE extracts attributes from the images to enrich
        * LOSG to replace BIL
        * Listing Quality Dashboard

* ATL/BTL very tricky question - HC restrictions
* tracking, for Smart Flat File, will measure incremental HC, time to list, will not move a lot as Dom SPs will only impact those SPs...
* for all others, 7d & first attempt should go down
* all will impact selection
* most will impact catalog quality & time to list
* risks 

* single forum - how to make sure we stay connected: monthly MBR from SPS was very tech oriented, decided to have a separate MBR for LIsting Friction (first session is this week, Marco will be there)

* what to push for : smart sheet, ASIN list also - let's pilot if it works, then expand
