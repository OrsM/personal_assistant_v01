* happy thanksgiving - livestream of the world cup

* Strategy doc for INX - pitched it to Phung, mentioned to Chris - they did not sound super warm to the idea
    * reduced scope for the doc (co-owned with Nitesh), specific improvements for perceived equivalents, more operational - will share a working backwards plan next week, ETA is Dec
    * I've done some thinking on tenets & prioritizaiton of use cases, but I don't think I have the right platform to drive this
* step back - INX is this ever evolving conceptual priority in pricing, no clear owner, some level of funding; if I am Christa, Radu - telling your teams figure out a way to do this - teams are scrambling to do it, they're not naturally thinking to have someone not on their teams owning the strategy; we're WW, we lead the strategy, we collect use cases - Miguel driving INX for EU - I say I can do more, can work on the strategy; they are saying there's no way this is owned outside of your team -- do you fight that battle on this? yes for personal growth, position as a leader, ability (huge win if you can convince Garret, Christa) to own this super critical thing; reality is does not seem likely to win them over; i can play my role, push for this --- be a contributor / voice in the room (this seems the likely outcome knowing Christa & Garrett), and so much happening on this we have no visibility on this is CMT (not just Nitesh either (Gaurav Tyagi & Gitanjali's team are critical owners & working directly, also in Christa's team driving docs)

* 1-1 Chris bandwidth - who's driving those docs - this is the strategy docs, just classifying the different use cases, find out who the author is - we still need a PM, have a very direct 1-1 with Chris on this topic, I think this is where you see me & i'd like to be in a different place, need someone to dedicate time to it. Read off of this, see what he says.

* SIC INX metric not the right metric - Urmi
* IC INX goal - IC Box goal INX - check exclusion of offer INX with ship times & ship speeds are different

* Economic situation, amazon changes - your take
    * tenets & LPs - will they stick?
    * helps focus on innovation - competitor governance - focus on Image; push on financial impacts for pricing decisions - long term financials, remain customer centric
    * personal level, wait till Q1, layoffs - no control, long runway, backburner
